# SJODataKit

Some simple and lightweight additions to the Core Data stack to help reduce the boilerplate code in your app.

##Overview

###SJODataStore

This class manages the Core Data setup and initialisation for an application. The model is automatically loaed from the bundle, and lightweight migration is enabled. 
Best practice would be to create an `SJODataStore` as a property on your appDelegate, then pass this to the view controllers as needed.


###NSManagedObject(SJODataKitAdditions)

Additions to `NSManagedObject` to reduce boilerplate and simplify common operations.
These methods never should __never__ be called directly on NSManagedObject (e.g. `[NSManagedObject entityName]`), but instead only on subclasses.

###SJOSearchableFetchedResultsController
This class provides a simpler way to replicate the often-used pattern of a searchable Core Data-backed table view. Must be used as a subclass.

Usage
=======
Add the following to your `Podfile`:

    pod 'SJODataKit', '~> 0.2'

Import `SJODataKit.h` in your project.
